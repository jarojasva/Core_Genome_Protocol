# A protocol to extract the Core_genome

Hi! Here is a protocol for extracting the core genome from a group of genomes, using proteinortho (https://gitlab.com/paulklemm_PHD/proteinortho), Python, and Bash. At the end, the concatenated amino acid fasta of the core genome will be obtained to then align (e.g. MAFFT) and perform your phylogenetic analyses.
